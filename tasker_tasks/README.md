Use the [generic_task](https://github.com/Aephir/Tasker_Files/blob/master/tasker_tasks/generic_task) for any service in home assistant (e.g. turn on/off lights, etc). Here, you need to change the service call and the entitty (under `Custom body`).
Under "Headers", you need to insert your long lived token (created in home assistant UI)
